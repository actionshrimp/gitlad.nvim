TODOs:
- [x] Show refs on the log views in the status buffer
- [x] Add `origin/` and local ref highlighting to those refs in those views to see if things are in sync
- [x] Add that same highlighting to the refs at the top of the status buffer (e.g. Push: branch)
- [ ] is git hook output definitely streaming?
- [ ] pressing 'p' on a stash directly tries to pop it, should open the popup menu instead
- [ ] When first opening, it would be cool to show the same refreshing icon as on the status buffer as the first line, also maybe move it to the first line on status too?
