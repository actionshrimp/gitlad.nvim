TODOs:
- [ ] Show refs on the log views in the status buffer
- [ ] Add `origin/` and local ref highlighting to those refs in those views to see if things are in sync
- [ ] Add that same highlighting to the refs at the top of the status buffer (e.g. Push: branch)
- [ ] is git hook output definitely streaming?
- [ ] pressing 'p' on a stash directly tries to pop it, should open the popup menu instead
