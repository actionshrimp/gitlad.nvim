- [x] do we have tests that check the actual git config values are being updated in the file correctly? if not can we add some
- [x] when the upstream is changed, can we force a refresh of the git state, as the status window is highly dependent on that config
- [x] better 'q' behaviour and buffer tracking
- [x] when reopening status buffer, position cursor at first item (not header)
- [x] discard hunks with 'x' - we can discard whole files but this should also work at hunk level
- [x] "diffs" / pressing RET on stashes doesnt seem to work. Does diffview support this?
- [x] update casing of 'pushremote' in places where it's all lower case to 'pushRemote'
- [x] is there some way we can make partial staging of untracked files work? perhaps with `git add -N` followed by a similar approach to how we do staging of visually selected lines for unstaged changes?
- [x] add 'o' to push popup (push other branch)
- [x] 'no upstream configured for main, cannot spin off'
- [x] configurable status buffer sections: allow users to configure the order and presence of different sections (staged, unstaged, untracked, worktrees, stashes, etc.) - some users may not want certain sections shown or may prefer them at different positions. Could also include section-specific options like 'number of recent commits' to display.
- [x] Can we add a 'view is stale' indicator? I dont want it to actually ever interrupt what the user is doing, but if we async detect the git state has changed, we should update our 'idle/loading' header (which shows the spinner) to some kind of alert state to prompt the user to do a manual refresh. this might be a good case for an actual background/file watcher as an initial test run. but this should be configurable, some users may not want it turned on.
- [x] Weird highlighting issue where line highlighting somehow gets enabled and line numbers disappear - this is actually my themes 'terminal' styles and nvim's default behaviour to open new files in buffers other than `nofile` buffers. need to adapt workflow
- [x] something is a bit off when staging an entirely new (previously untracked) directory - we just see the dir staged and not the individual files, which show up as hunks for some reason. we _do_ expect to see just the directory name in the 'untracked' section, but when staged it should expand to the individual files
- [x] display of renamed files could be better, using the /common/path/to/{suba/a.txt -> subb/b.txt} style
- [x] git rebase continue fails if there are conflicts and you need to confirm the updated commit message (with Conflicts: section) - not implemented
- [x] worktree 'sibling' strat - can we make it default to `../branch-name` rather than `_branch-name`? what does magit do?
- [x] when confirming an edit after a rebase conflict, we should go back to the status window and not the empty buffer
- [x] are our worktree popup keys the same as magit evil collection?
- [x] still a slight issue with our new 'intent to add' feature and the staging of a new directory ;(
- [x] can we render ansi terminal colour codes nicely in the hook popup output?
- [ ] setting upstream to a local branch doesnt work properly
- [ ] for a moved file, only show the actual file changes in the diff
- [ ] improve look and feel of '$' / command history (from screenshot)
- [ ] hook output window should only appear if hooks are actually configured. Before implementing, consider a holistic approach: detect configured hooks and show progress/output for all git operations that may trigger them (commit, push, etc.). This may warrant a dedicated phase in PLAN.md.
- [ ] some kind of display of queued git operations so you know git is still working underneath for slow operations?
- [ ] when running `SPC p t` from status buffer i get an error as neovim doesnt think it's a real project directory
- [ ] why is 'origin' listed as a ref under the origin remote
- [ ] unstage new files from unstaged back to untracked doesnt work with visual selection
- [ ] from refs view, trying to diff my branch against develop with `...` doesnt work.
